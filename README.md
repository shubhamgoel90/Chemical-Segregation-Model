# Chemical-Segregation-Model
In this repository we are classifying between two chemicals using Logistic Regression and building the algorithm from scratch.

A chemist has two chemical flasks labelled 1 and 0 which contains two different chemicals. He extracted 3 features from these chemicals in order to distinguish between them. We are provided with the results derived by the chemist and our task is to create a model that will label chemical 0 or 1 given its three features.

We are provided with two files test and train.

### Train:-
  This files consists of two csv files Logistic_X_train and Logistic_Y_train. X_train consists of the features whereas Y_train consists of the labels associated with the features.

### Test:-
  This file consists of two files Logistic_X_test consisting of the features of test data and sample_output which represents in which format your solution csv must be submitted.

We need to implement any classifier from scratch, don't use any sklearn based classifier.

### Libraries Used:-
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib.pyplot
